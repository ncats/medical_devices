This contains all the work I (Christopher Bach) did during my NIH Summer Internship 2019 at NCATS. 
1. The Medical Device Inventory Document contains some of the definitions of the terminology used, like the three FDA Classes and the FDA's definition of a medical device is, and 
some useful links. 

2. The Medical Device Inventory Excel file contains all the data gatherred from different FDA databases like the CFR and PMA or 510(k) databases, and where all the analysis of the 
data occurred. 

3. HDE Data contains only data about HDE devices from the HDE database.

4. Scrape Code is the code used to gather the data found in the webpages of the CFR.

5. The NCATS Informatics Presentation and NCATS Poster were all used to present my findings during my presentation and Poster Days respectively.
